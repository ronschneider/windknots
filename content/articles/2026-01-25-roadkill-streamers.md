summary: "If you want to target hefty trout, forget the small stuff—streamers are your ticket to tight lines, accounting for a staggering 42% of four-pound fish caught in Livingston, Montana. Patterns like Woolly Buggers and Bitch Creeks can dominate in fast water, especially when you employ a slow, deliberate retrieve to mimic injured prey. Don’t miss the chance to amp up your streamer game and hook into those rising fish; the water’s waiting for your next cast!"
