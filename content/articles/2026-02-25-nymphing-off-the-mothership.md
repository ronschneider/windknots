summary: "I was looking through old pictures from when I was guiding from a mothership in Oman. We would get schools of fish hanging out in our lights at night, and I figured out I could drift little flies to them in the tidal current.Pictured are a Lunar Fusilier, a black tip trevally, a striped fusilier, a flagtail, a wave Garrick/dart."
