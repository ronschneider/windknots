summary: "Have found myself targeting panfish and wild brookies in small creeks with lots of brush and trees more lately. Wanting some opinions on a 3wt under or around the 300 dollar mark. Love my clearwater but wanting different from Orvis just to try another brand as well. Plan on using dries, nymphs, and small streamers."
