summary: "Got bored and had access to a while bunch of fly tying supplies. Figured I should likely have a concept of it being the local fly club president. haven't tied a fly since 1993 at the Scout jamboree. seems to have turned out fine, not sure if it would survive a cast. Not sure what it's for."
