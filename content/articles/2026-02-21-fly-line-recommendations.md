summary: "So\n I recently purchased a 7 foot 63 weight that I plan to use in small streams and little ponds for bluegill and trout. What's some good lines you guys use on a 3 weight rod, I'm assuming just a standard wait forward floating line? Bit open to different ideas. I currently own a 8 weight and a 6 and a 5 weight.This is my first 3 weight."
