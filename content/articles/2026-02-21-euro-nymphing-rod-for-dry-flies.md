summary: "I recently ordered a diamondback gen 4 online. The more I’m researching, it almost seems as though it could be viable as a dry fly rod as well. Is this true? If so, what qualities that a euro rod have that cross over into a dry fly rod? I purchase a 10’7”3wt. I know that there’s no “rules” but I want some opinions and knowledge."
