    editorial_intro: |
      The 2026 rod releases are hitting shops, and we're seeing some interesting trends. Faster actions continue to dominate the trout category, but several manufacturers are offering medium-action alternatives for those who prefer a more traditional feel.

      This week's reviews cover rods from Sage, Scott, and Winston—three different philosophies on what a modern trout rod should do.

      Wild steelhead populations continue to face pressure from multiple directions. This week's conservation coverage highlights advocacy efforts on the Olympic Peninsula and Columbia Basin, where anglers are organizing to influence upcoming management decisions.
