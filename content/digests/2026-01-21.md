  description: Planning your South Island trout expedition
  editorial_intro: 'New Zealand''s summer season is in full swing, and anglers fortunate enough to be planning trips are getting into fish. This week''s travel coverage focuses on the South Island backcountry—what
    to expect, how to prepare, and the gear that actually matters when you''re hiking miles to fish.


    The overwhelming consensus: go lighter than you think. These fish see few anglers and don''t require a fully stocked vest.
