I recently purchased a 7 foot 63 weight that I plan to use in small streams and little ponds for bluegill and trout. What&amp;rsquo;s some good lines you guys use on a 3 weight rod, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming just a standard wait forward floating line? Bit open to different ideas. I currently own a 8 weight and a 6 and a 5 weight.This is my first 3 weight.</description></item><item><title>Which 5wt: Redington Classic Trout OR Echo Carbon XL?</title><link>https://windknots.com/articles/2026-02-21-which-5wt-redington-classic-trout-or-echo-carbon-xl/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 19:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://windknots.com/articles/2026-02-21-which-5wt-redington-classic-trout-or-echo-carbon-xl/</guid><description>Debating on which one of these I should get for my first 5 wt rod.

The insight from fellow anglers shows that while the fundamentals of casting and retrieving remain, the nuances of saltwater fishing require some tweaking. Whether you’re fishing the beaches of La Paz or the jungles of Costa Rica, adapting your skills is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the Reddit threads where anglers share their saltwater debut experiences. One newbie was thrown right into the chaos of feeding fish, learning that a fast retrieve and the right bait can make all the difference. Or consider the podcast with Kevin Jackson, packing in the reality that not only can you target tarpon and trout on the same trip, but you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to adjust your approach depending on the conditions. So, if you’ve been slinging flies for trout in your local river and think you’re ready for some salt, pay attention.
